# Franka Emika Panda - MuJoCo RGB-D Sim

This repository contains a modular **MuJoCo** simulation setup for the Franka Emika Panda robot, developed by **Pedro Crisp**, **Enzo Kozonoe**, and **Murilo Gebra**.

It was created within the scope of the **Chair of Cyber-Physical Systems** at **Montanuniversität Leoben**, serving as a testbed for generating synthetic RGB-D data for grasp detection tasks.

**Current Focus:**

* Setting up the XML architecture (robot, scene, objects).
* Simulating a table-top scenario with manipulatable objects.
* Generating accurate camera data for Computer Vision applications.
